# Importance of Primary Keys for CDC-Enabled Tables

This document outlines why **primary keys** are essential for tables with **Change Data Capture (CDC)** enabled, with a focus on their benefits for the `@support_net_changes` option and integration with change consumers like **Amazon DMS**.

---

## 1. Ensures Accurate Tracking of Changes
- **Primary keys** provide a unique identifier for each row, allowing CDC to accurately track **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, and **DELETE** operations.
- Without a primary key, CDC cannot uniquely associate changes with specific rows, leading to potential issues in change detection and replication.

---

## 2. Enables `@support_net_changes` for Efficient Change Summarization
- The `@support_net_changes` option allows consumers to retrieve only the **net changes** for a table during a specified time frame.
  - Example: Consumers receive the final state of the row (the net change) instead of all intermediate changes.
- **Primary keys** are critical for this feature because:
  - They ensure CDC can consolidate multiple operations on the same row into a single net change.
  - They prevent ambiguity when determining which row a net change applies to.

---

## 3. Optimizes CDC Query Performance
- Change tables generated by CDC include a column for the primary key, enabling efficient querying of changes.
- For **large datasets**, primary keys significantly improve the performance of change detection and retrieval.
- They reduce processing overhead, especially for tools like **Amazon DMS** that rely on efficient log-based replication.

---

## 4. Facilitates Reliable Data Replication with Amazon DMS
- **Amazon Database Migration Service (DMS)** relies on primary keys for accurate data replication:
  - **Uniqueness:** Ensures each change corresponds to a specific row.
  - **Conflict Resolution:** Helps resolve conflicts when multiple changes occur on the same row during replication.
  - **Row Identification:** Allows DMS to efficiently identify and apply changes to the target database.
- Without a primary key, DMS may encounter challenges in accurately replaying changes.

---

## 5. Supports Data Integrity During Change Replication
- Primary keys ensure that the replicated data remains consistent with the source database.
- For CDC, where **log-based change capture** is used, primary keys help maintain data integrity by ensuring:
  - Correct application of changes in the target.
  - Prevention of duplicate rows or missed changes.

---

## 6. Critical for Merge Operations in Consumers
- For systems consuming CDC changes (like ETL pipelines or custom applications), primary keys are necessary for **merge operations**:
  - Merging incoming changes with existing data in a target system requires unique identifiers to match rows.
  - Without primary keys, these merge operations may fail or require complex workarounds that are error-prone.

---

## 7. Simplifies CDC Administration
- Enabling CDC on tables with primary keys simplifies administration tasks:
  - CDC jobs are easier to configure and maintain.
  - Troubleshooting issues related to row changes becomes straightforward because primary keys provide clear traceability.

---

## 8. Prevents CDC Feature Limitations
- Some CDC features may not work properly or be unsupported on tables without primary keys:
  - **Net changes queries (`cdc.fn_cdc_get_net_changes_<capture_instance>`):** Require primary keys to function.
  - **Optimized log scanning:** CDC uses primary keys to optimize how it reads and processes changes from the transaction log.

---

## 9. Ensures Compatibility with Third-Party Tools
- Many third-party tools (e.g., **Amazon DMS**, **ETL pipelines**, **data warehouses**) require primary keys to process and apply CDC changes reliably.
- Without primary keys, integration with such tools may fail or require custom logic, increasing complexity.

---

## 10. Reduces Risk of Data Loss or Duplication
- Primary keys reduce the risk of data loss or duplication during:
  - CDC-enabled data replication.
  - Downstream processes consuming CDC changes.
- This is especially critical in high-volume transactional systems where accuracy is paramount.

## Recommendations
- Always define a **primary key** on tables intended for CDC.
- For tables without natural primary keys, consider adding a **surrogate key** (e.g., an auto-incremented ID) to enable CDC compatibility and maximize benefits.
