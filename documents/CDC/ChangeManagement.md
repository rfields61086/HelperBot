If your team has no experience with source control but needs a manageable change management process, here are some simple and effective options to help get started. These options are tailored for teams with limited technical experience but can scale as your team gains familiarity with more advanced tools.

### **1. Manual Versioning with Shared Documentation**
- **What It Is:** Keep track of changes manually using a shared document or spreadsheet.
- **How It Works:**
  - Use a table format with columns for:
    - **Date**
    - **Description of Change**
    - **Affected Tables/Objects**
    - **Reason for Change**
    - **Person Responsible**
  - Save the document in a shared, accessible location (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive).
- **Best Practices:**
  - Assign one team member as the "change manager" to ensure updates are logged consistently.
  - Add a "Proposed Changes" section for team review before changes are applied.

### **2. Database Change Log Table**
- **What It Is:** Create a dedicated table within the database to log changes to schema, CDC configuration, or other critical elements.
- **How It Works:**
  - Set up a table, e.g., `ChangeLog`, with columns such as:
    - `ChangeID` (Primary Key)
    - `ChangeDate` (Date/Time of change)
    - `ChangedBy` (Person who made the change)
    - `ChangeDescription` (Details of the change)
    - `AffectedObjects` (Tables, columns, or other affected items)
  - Use an application or manual input process to log changes whenever they occur.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Require entries to the change log before applying any change.
  - Include a `ChangeApproved` flag to indicate reviewed changes.

### **3. Email-Based Change Approval Workflow**
- **What It Is:** Use email threads as a lightweight approval system for database changes.
- **How It Works:**
  - Before making any changes, send an email to relevant stakeholders with:
    - **Description of the change**
    - **Reason/Justification**
    - **Expected Impact**
  - Require team approval (at least one other team member) before proceeding.
  - Archive approved emails in a dedicated folder for future reference.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Standardize email templates for consistency.
  - Use subject lines like `[Database Change Request]` to track easily.
  - Periodically consolidate email approvals into a centralized document.

### **4. Use a Simple Change Management Tool**
- **What It Is:** Leverage beginner-friendly tools designed for task tracking and change management.
- **Tool Options:**
  - **Trello:** Create a board with columns for "Proposed Changes," "Under Review," and "Completed Changes."
  - **ClickUp/Asana:** Use these to assign, track, and document changes with minimal learning curve.
  - **Google Forms:** Set up a form to collect change requests, with fields for description, reason, and approval status.
- **How It Works:**
  - Log all proposed changes in the tool.
  - Assign a reviewer or approver for each change.
  - Move approved changes to the "Completed" section once implemented.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Start with minimal fields and increase complexity as the team becomes comfortable.
  - Use the tool’s built-in export functionality to create change logs.

### **5. Incremental Introduction of Git for Source Control**
- **What It Is:** Gradually introduce source control concepts using tools like Git, focusing only on database-related scripts at first.
- **How It Works:**
  - Start by saving database change scripts in a shared repository using a GUI-based Git client like **GitHub Desktop** or **Sourcetree**.
  - Use basic Git workflows:
    - Commit changes with clear messages (e.g., `Added CDC to Orders table`).
    - Push changes to a shared repository for team collaboration.
  - Maintain a folder structure to organize scripts (e.g., `SchemaChanges/YYYY-MM-DD_Description.sql`).
- **Best Practices:**
  - Provide basic training on Git concepts like committing, pulling, and pushing.
  - Use a shared repository on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Azure DevOps.
  - Gradually introduce branching strategies as the team gains confidence.

---

### **6. Scheduled Change Review Meetings**
- **What It Is:** Use regular meetings to review and approve proposed changes collaboratively.
- **How It Works:**
  - Team members prepare a list of proposed changes in advance.
  - During the meeting, discuss the following for each change:
    - Impact on existing processes.
    - How CDC configuration will be affected.
    - Rollback or contingency plans.
  - Document approved changes and assign implementation responsibilities.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Keep meetings short and focused on significant changes.
  - Share meeting minutes with all stakeholders.

---

### **7. Change Tracking Using SQL Server Extended Properties**
- **What It Is:** Use SQL Server's built-in extended properties to annotate database objects with metadata about changes.
- **How It Works:**
  - Use `sp_addextendedproperty` to add notes to tables or columns about when and why changes were made.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    EXEC sp_addextendedproperty 
      @name = N'LastModified', 
      @value = 'Added CDC on 2024-11-25 by John Doe for reporting.',
      @level0type = N'SCHEMA', @level0name = N'dbo',
      @level1type = N'TABLE',  @level1name = N'Orders';
    ```
  - Query extended properties for a quick summary of recent changes.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use consistent naming conventions for properties.
  - Regularly audit extended properties for completeness.

### Recommendation for Your Team
If the team is completely new to change management, **start small and keep it simple**:
1. Combine **manual versioning** with a **change review meeting** process for immediate structure.
2. Introduce a simple tool like Trello or ClickUp to formalize tracking without overwhelming the team.
3. Gradually introduce **Git-based source control** or **extended properties** as the team becomes comfortable with the workflow.

These approaches allow your team to implement change management at a manageable pace while building familiarity with industry-standard practices. Let me know if you’d like to expand on any of these!
