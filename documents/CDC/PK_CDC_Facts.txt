1. Ensures Accurate Tracking of Changes
Primary keys provide a unique identifier for each row, allowing CDC to accurately track INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.
Without a primary key, CDC cannot uniquely associate changes with specific rows, leading to potential issues in change detection and replication.
2. Enables @support_net_changes for Efficient Change Summarization
The @support_net_changes option in CDC allows consumers to retrieve only the net changes for a table during a specified time frame.
Example: Instead of seeing every intermediate change to a row, consumers receive the final state of the row (the net change).
Primary keys are critical for this feature because they:
Ensure that CDC can consolidate multiple operations on the same row into a single net change.
Prevent ambiguity when determining which row a net change applies to.
3. Optimizes CDC Query Performance
Change tables generated by CDC include a column for the primary key, enabling efficient querying of changes.
When querying CDC logs, especially for large datasets, primary keys significantly improve the performance of change detection and retrieval.
They reduce the overhead of processing and scanning, particularly for tools like Amazon DMS that rely on efficient log-based replication.
4. Facilitates Reliable Data Replication with Amazon DMS
Amazon Database Migration Service (DMS) heavily relies on primary keys to replicate data changes accurately:
Uniqueness: Ensures each change corresponds to a specific row.
Conflict Resolution: Helps resolve conflicts when multiple changes occur on the same row during replication.
Row Identification: Allows DMS to efficiently identify and apply changes to the target database.
Without a primary key, DMS may encounter challenges in accurately replaying changes in the target system.
5. Supports Data Integrity During Change Replication
Primary keys ensure that the replicated data remains consistent with the source database.
For CDC, where log-based change capture is used, primary keys help maintain data integrity by ensuring:
Correct application of changes in the target.
Prevention of duplicate rows or missed changes.
6. Critical for Merge Operations in Consumers
For systems consuming CDC changes (like ETL pipelines or custom applications), primary keys are necessary for merge operations:
Merging incoming changes with existing data in a target system requires unique identifiers to match rows.
Without primary keys, these merge operations may fail or require complex workarounds that are error-prone.
7. Simplifies CDC Administration
Enabling CDC on tables with primary keys simplifies administration tasks:
CDC jobs are easier to configure and maintain.
Troubleshooting issues related to row changes becomes straightforward because primary keys provide clear traceability.
8. Prevents CDC Feature Limitations
Some CDC features may not work properly or be unsupported on tables without primary keys:
Net changes queries (cdc.fn_cdc_get_net_changes_<capture_instance>): Require primary keys to function.
Optimized log scanning: CDC uses primary keys to optimize the way it reads and processes changes from the transaction log.
9. Ensures Compatibility with Third-Party Tools
Many third-party tools (e.g., Amazon DMS, ETL pipelines, data warehouses) require primary keys to process and apply CDC changes reliably.
Without primary keys, integration with such tools may fail or require custom logic, increasing complexity.
10. Reduces Risk of Data Loss or Duplication
Primary keys reduce the risk of data loss or duplication during:
CDC-enabled data replication.
Downstream processes consuming CDC changes.
This is especially critical in high-volume transactional systems where accuracy is paramount.
Summary Table of Benefits
Feature/Benefit	Primary Key Role
Accurate change tracking	Uniquely identifies rows for CDC changes
Support for @support_net_changes	Enables summarization of changes into net results
CDC query performance	Improves efficiency of querying change tables
Reliable replication with Amazon DMS	Ensures accurate and conflict-free data replication
Data integrity	Maintains consistency during replication and application
Merge operations	Simplifies merging changes in target systems
CDC administration	Simplifies job management and troubleshooting
Compatibility with tools	Ensures smooth integration with third-party consumers
Prevents CDC limitations	Avoids feature limitations in CDC without primary keys
Data loss and duplication prevention	Reduces risks in replication and change processing
Recommendations:
Always define a primary key on tables intended for CDC.
For tables without natural primary keys, consider adding a surrogate key (e.g., an auto-incremented ID) to enable CDC compatibility and maximize benefits.
